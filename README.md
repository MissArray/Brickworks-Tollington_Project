# Description - Fork
The original project is an MVP built for promoting Brickworks, in the Tollington area, London, as a social-action hub for the local community.
This fork was inspired by a call on FAC14 of Founders & Coders to take part in the 2018 Hacktober Fest. I focused _exclusively_ on design and front end and made no changes to the back end, for which all credit goes to Sangita Sunuwar and Harry Mead.

### Purpose
* Apply, expand and refine the layout I originally proposed to the Brickworks-Tollington team, which combines a grid and flexbox
* Create and implement a responsive design
